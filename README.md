  ## Description
  This is an application designed to make taking and organising notes simple and efficient. When the user visits the index page they are greeted and presented with a button, that when clicked will take them to a seperate notes.html page where the user can(if applicable) view existing notes, where they can either delete or update them. The user can also create a new note on the same page which will then be added to the existing list.
